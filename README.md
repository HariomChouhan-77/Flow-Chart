🚦 Traffic Prediction — Interactive Flowchart
📌 Introduction

Traffic congestion is a growing problem in Indian cities, causing delays, fuel wastage, and pollution.
This project demonstrates an AI-powered Traffic Prediction System with an engaging interactive flowchart (HTML/CSS/JS) to visualize the workflow.

🎯 Objective

Predict traffic volume based on time, weather, and other features.

Provide insights into rush hours to help citizens, businesses, and city planners.

Make the process visual and interactive with a smooth UI flowchart.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle Traffic Prediction Dataset

Size: 9000 records

Features:

Date & Time

Temperature

Weather conditions

Traffic volume (vehicles/hour)

⚙️ Workflow (Visualized in Flowchart)

Start

Collect Traffic Dataset (9k records from Kaggle)

Data Cleaning → Handle missing values, format datetime

Feature Engineering → Hour, Day of week, Temperature, Weather

Model Training → Machine Learning for traffic prediction

Predictions → Forecast volume for given time

Insights/Visualization → Rush hour detection, traffic trends

Application for Indore → Route optimization, city planning, citizen alerts

End

👉 Each step is shown in the interactive flowchart with animated connectors and popup details on click.

📊 Results

Morning (8–10 AM) and Evening (5–7 PM) → Peak traffic

Midday & Late night → Lower traffic volume

💡 Applications in Indore

🚗 Citizens: Plan travel in non-peak hours

📦 Delivery Companies: Optimize routes, reduce delays

🏙 City Planners: Adjust traffic signals & manage congestion
